# Project Idea: Generative Art using Blockchain.
**An Interactive website using ReactJS that will use crypto hashesh to make a number of Avatars as NFTs minted on [Palm](palm.io, "Palm").**

## Why Palm?
Palm is a new NFT ecosystem for culture and creativity, built efficiently with Ethereum. The Palm ecosystem features low gas costs, fast transaction finality, and is over 99.9% more energy efficient than Proof of Work systems.

Palm is designed from the ground up to be as flexible as artists are creative. Today, we are making NFTs easier and more efficient to use with an Ethereum sidechain, and have a roadmap to transition to an Ethereum Layer 2.

## Project Map
### Phase 1:
Building an Interactive Interface for user to Connect an Ethereum Wallet [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

### Phase 1 Part 2:
Adding [Palm](palm.io) Blockchain configurations to users Metamask Using Custom RPCs.

### Phase 2:
Using Blockchain Technologies to Create a Hash for each Wallet Connected To site and Use it as an Variable to create an Avatar.
### Phase 3:
Using Solidity and Infura to mint an NFT on [Palm](palm.io) sidechain and adding it to user's Wallet.
