## Project Idea: Submitting A Paper on Blockchain

Since the beginning of the NFTs and IPFS era, one thing that is missing in this market is publishing scientific papers on blockchain.

Based on my research on this idea, most platforms for submitting papers are relying on a centralized organizations to publishing and that can be a problem.

Like every other centralized organizations, there is no proof that they don't censor the papers and make them in their favor, So a platform for Researchers who are doing research on uncomfortable subjects like pollution monitoring or the impact of big corps on the Nature is always getting censored or impacted by this centralized organizations.

So using a platform like [Palm](palm.io) which is eco-friendly and decentralized will help to develop this idea.

## Why Palm?
Palm is a new NFT ecosystem for culture and creativity, built efficiently with Ethereum. The Palm ecosystem features low gas costs, fast transaction finality, and is over 99.9% more energy efficient than Proof of Work systems.

Palm is designed from the ground up to be as flexible as artists are creative. Today, we are making NFTs easier and more efficient to use with an Ethereum side-chain, and have a roadmap to transition to an Ethereum Layer 2.

# Project Map
- [ ] Phase 1: Building Minting NFTs Smart Contract Using [NFT Storage](https://nft.storage) as [IPFS](IPFS.io) helper and [Infura](infra.io) as gateway to deploy Contract on [Palm](palm.io) side-chain.

	- Using [OpenZepplin](openzeppelin.com) as a Standard ERC1155 Contract
	- Using [Infura](infra.io) as gateway and [Metamask](metamask.io) to interact with [Palm](palm.io) blockchain.
- [ ] Phase 2: Build Interactive Website using Vanilla JS for users to mint their papers
